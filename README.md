# ecommerce database design project

This project illustrates a few of the databases that an ecommerce firm might have to work with on a daily basis. From the point of initial interaction of a user to the delivery of the product, the tables are updated. 

The project consists of five files which create tables  such as Customer, Product, Transaction etc. The queries.sql file consists of sql commands that deal with data retrieval.
